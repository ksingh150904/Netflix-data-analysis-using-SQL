## ðŸ§  Queries Used

### 1. **Data Selection & Filtering**
- Basic `SELECT` statements to inspect and fetch specific columns
- `WHERE` clause to filter data by conditions such as country, release year, or type

### 2. **Aggregation & Grouping**
- `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to calculate frequency (e.g., number of movies per genre or year)
- `AVG()` to find average durations, ratings, etc.

### 3. **Sorting and Ranking**
- `ORDER BY` to rank data (e.g., most recent releases, most produced genres)
- `LIMIT` to fetch top-N results

### 4. **Joins**
- `INNER JOIN` / `LEFT JOIN` to combine datasets (e.g., linking shows with director info or country)

### 5. **String Operations**
- `LIKE`, `SUBSTRING()`, `TRIM()` to extract or filter based on titles or descriptions

### 6. **Date-Based Queries**
- Use of `YEAR()`, `MONTH()` on date fields to perform time series analysis
- Filtering shows added or released in specific years

### 7. **Conditional Logic**
- `CASE WHEN` used to categorize shows by type or duration
